## 💡 What is cURL?

cURL (short for *Client URL*) is a command-line tool for transferring data with URLs. It supports a wide range of protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Whether you're testing APIs, downloading files, or sending data, cURL is a must-have tool in any developer's toolkit.

## 🔧 Basic Usage

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/data
```

This command fetches data from the given URL using a GET request.

## 📬 Sending Data

### POST JSON

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/data \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}'
```

Use `-X` to specify the HTTP method, `-H` to add headers, and `-d` to send data.

### Form Submission

```bash
curl -F "username=alice" -F "password=secret" https://example.com/login
```

`-F` sends form fields like a regular HTML form.

## 🔍 Inspecting Responses

```bash
curl -i https://example.com
```

Shows both headers and body.

```bash
curl -v https://example.com
```

Enables verbose mode to see the request/response in detail.

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* 🗂 Save output to a file: `curl -o output.html https://example.com`
* 🧪 Test APIs quickly with custom headers and methods
* 🔒 Handle HTTPS: `curl --insecure` skips SSL verification (not recommended for production)
* ⏱ Benchmarking: `curl -w "Time: %{time_total}\n" -o /dev/null -s https://example.com`
